#Introduction:

The Coronavirus disease which is called as the COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral illness which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus are considered to be the family of viruses that cause illness such as respiratory diseases or gastrointestinal diseases and can also cause death. The first cases of this predominantly respiratory viral illness were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019. Thereafter when this spread across the world in a short span of time, compelled the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the outbreak as a global pandemic on the March 11, 2020. Globally as of December 2021, there have been 280,119,931 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 5,403,662 deaths, reported by WHO.

The COVID-19 is broadly spread by the dust particles and fomites while close unsafe touch between an infector and the infected person happens. The virus travels in respiratory droplets released into air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or breathes near you and a person can be affected by inhaling these droplets. The Airborne distribution for COVID-19 has not been recorded as it is not known to be a significant transmission. Fast spreading has been seen in certain patients, and the active virus has been reported in a small number of clinical studies. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, often include fever, cough, headache, difficulty in breathing, loss of smell and taste and few more. By wearing masks in public, keeping distance from others and by often sanitizing themselves, we can reduce the chances of infection being spread. The WHO continues to encourage each and every individual to take care of their own health and also protect others by following all the guidelines generated.

#Summary:

Coronavirus Pandemic now appears to be the most serious infected spreading disease like any other wide-spread diseases. Because of drastic rise in the number of COVID-19 cases during pandemic, it has caused severe problems in the healthcare sector to come up with appropriate and suitable treatment solutions. Machine Leaning methodologies are used as a different method for classification and prediction of virus. In our project the supervised Machine Learning classification model for COVID-19 virus developed using K Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The data mining techniques can be implemented with the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm which plays a prominent role in diagnosing the COVID-19 or coronavirus infection which is declared as pandemic by World Health Organization.

 By implementing K Nearest Neighbors algorithm in our project we can conclude that, 

 • The standard symptoms of covid-19 detection cases are verified effectively:
 • Increasing the prediction accuracy to 90%+ efficiency using K Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning technique. 
 • Based on the value we can easily detect multi-class prediction.
 • K Nearest Neighbors performs better compared to other models like LR, LDA, CART, NB and SVM with less training data.
 • Accurate output prediction will be useful and fruit-full for humanity and to detect the virus in the early stage and safe lot of lives.
